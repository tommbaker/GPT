Rules of the Game
=================

This is a trading game (not real money) in which you can buy and sell 'shares' in a driver. Payouts are given for each share you have in a driver that meets the conditions below (overtaking or being in the lead).

Payouts are awarded in as close to real-time as possible based on live events happening at the race.

As in real markets, money can also be made or lost on the varying price of shares.

Payouts
-------

* Each player will receive $1500 when the market opens for each race.

* $400 per share will be paid for each position gained by a driver.

* $200 per share will be paid for each lap a driver leads.

* [Share prices will vary between $100 - $200]

Conditions
----------

SFL = Start/Finish Line

* A driver's position, and therefore the number places a driver gained, is only counted when they cross the SFL (overtakes must be completed and the position held until the driver completes the lap).

* Payouts are based on the number of shares held when the driver crossed the SFL before the overtake NOT during the overtake or when a driver cross the SFL after the overtake.

	I.E. Prost crosses the SFL in #4 place and Senna in #5 place. During the lap Senna overtakes Prost and crosses the SFL ahead. To receive a payout for the position that was gained, shares in Senna must have been held when he previously crossed the SFL when he was behind Prost.

* When the lead driver crosses the SFL for the final time, trading will cease and you will receive market value for all the shares you hold. Any trading that occurs between the driver crossing the line and the system being updated will be reversed.
