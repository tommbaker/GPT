Rules of the Game
=================

This is a trading game in which you can buy and sell 'shares' in a driver during a race. Payouts are given for each share you have in a driver that overtakes or completes a lap in the lead (details below).

Payouts are awarded in as close to real-time as possible based on live events happening in the race.

As with real markets, money can also be made or lost on the varying price of shares. The markets are always open for trading (except for maintenance) and shares you have in a driver will carry over.

Payouts
-------

* Each player will receive $1500 on the monday before each race.

* $400 per share will be paid for each position gained by a driver (to incentivise trading before the race, $800 is paid for first lap gains).

* $100 per share will be paid for each lap a driver leads.

* (Share prices will vary between $100 - $200)

Conditions
----------

SFL = Start/Finish Line

* A driver's position, and therefore the number places a driver gained, is only counted when they cross the SFL (overtakes must be completed and the position held until the driver completes the lap).

* Payouts are based on the number of shares held when the driver crossed the SFL before the overtake NOT during the overtake or when a driver cross the SFL after the overtake.

	I.E. Prost crosses the SFL in #4 place and Senna in #5 place. During the lap Senna overtakes Prost and crosses the SFL ahead. To receive a payout for the position that was gained, shares in Senna must have been held when he previously crossed the SFL when he was behind Prost.

* When the lead driver crosses the SFL for the final time, trading will cease and you will receive market value for all the shares you hold. Any trading that occurs between the driver crossing the line and the system being updated will be reversed.

* Each trade will include .5% commision.
